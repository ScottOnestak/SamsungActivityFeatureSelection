--------------Recommendation---------------

I would recommend not running this algorithm on any laptop or computer that cannot handle a long computation time at maximum utilization of the machine.  Conducting a 5-fold cross-validation random forest algorithm took approximately 20 minutes to run on my machine using multi-threading.
